# Genetic Algorithm for the Knapsack problem
## Intro
The purpose of this algorithm is to show a possible implementation of the [Genetic algoritm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) to solve the minimization problem known as the [Knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).
